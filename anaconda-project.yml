# This project use a custom environment instead of installing on top of
# an existing environment. This is becaus Tensorflow 1.3 is a very old
# version, and installing it into an existing environment can cause
# conda to take a long time to compute a feaasible solution. Creating a
# fresh environment for Tensorflow 1.3 is significantly faster.
